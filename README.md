# Handwritten Digit Recognition with Neural Networks
This code repository is an implementation of a neural network for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. The assignment aims to build a model capable of accurately classifying digits from 0 to 9 based on pixel intensities.

## Assignment 2
The purpose of this assignment is to explore the application of neural networks in image classification tasks. The code utilizes a simple architecture with a dense neural network, including a hidden layer and dropout for regularization. The objective is to achieve high accuracy in recognizing handwritten digits.
